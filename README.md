Those are two project made for the transcriptomics exam.
The exam consisted in a bulk rna seq and a SC rna seq 
I also uploaded the pdf sent for the genomic exam.
In this project we had (as a group of 2) to find a rare genetic disease from the genome of both of the parents and the child. 
The project was done using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). The result of this project was 10/10 rare diseases found.
